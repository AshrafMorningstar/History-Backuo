=== PERSONAL MESSAGE ===

To whoever reads this:

My name is Ashraf Siddiqui. I started this journey at 7 years old, creating this private profile that has witnessed my entire digital evolution. Through 16 programming languages, countless projects, legal battles, personal struggles, and moments of triumph - this account has been my silent companion.

I've been known as Morningstar, AlfaZeus, RedEye, PixelMaster, ArtWizard, and many other aliases. Each name represents a chapter in my growth from a curious child to the person I am today.

The projects I created, the code I wrote, the designs I crafted - they were all steps in a journey of understanding not just technology, but humanity itself. I learned that technical skill means little without purpose, and that true strength comes from resilience in the face of adversity.

To those who doubted me because I worked in my father's shop - you never understood that greatness isn't about where you work, but what you create when no one is watching.

This repository contains my history - not just of code, but of a life lived passionately in the digital realm. I'm making this account public as my final contribution to the community that shaped me.

Remember: Your worth isn't measured by your GitHub contributions or your programming languages. It's measured by your integrity, your resilience, and your willingness to keep learning no matter the obstacles.

With gratitude and hope for the next generation of coders,

Ashraf Siddiqui (Morningstar)
January 2025
